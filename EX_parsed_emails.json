If you do not use direct deposit and still receive a paper check, please go to Direct Deposit Preferences in the About Me/Money section of Atlas to sign up. Direct deposit has many advantages over paper checks — it's safe, secure, and convenient — and you have immediate access to your pay, without having to deposit a check and wait for it to clear, as most banks give you access to your salary payment on payday morning. You can even have your salary deposited in more than one account or at more than one bank. If you no longer want to receive this notification, please change your preferences by clicking the Settings and Authorizations link at the top of the Paystubs page on Atlas. If you have questions about your paycheck or setting up direct deposit, please review the Payroll section of the Vice President for Finance (VPF) website or contact the VPF HR/Payroll Service Center at payroll@mit.edu or 617-253-4255.

Read on to learn more about a few upcoming changes to our open hours, road closures near our Cambridge location, answers to your questions about measles, and more. Upcoming MIT Health holiday hoursMIT Health will be closed — with the exception of Urgent Care — on the upcoming Memorial Day (May 26) and Juneteenth (June 19) holidays. Urgent Care will be open from 10 a.m.–4 p.m. both days. On Thursday, June 5, all MIT Health services, including Urgent Care, will be closed from 12–2 p.m. for an all-staff event. Bay State Physical Therapy will remain open. Construction to impact traffic around MIT HealthEversource and the City of Cambridge have kicked off the Greater Cambridge Energy Program (GCEP), a massive, multi-year initiative intended to address increased electric demand in the region, enhance the resiliency of the transmission system, and ensure a flexible electrical grid. The project will impact traffic in and around MIT Health, with road closures and detours on Ames Street beginning after commencement. Once construction begins, Ames Street will be closed between Memorial Drive and Amherst Street, and will be one-way northbound between Amherst Street and Main Street. The construction is anticipated to continue for 12–18 months. During this time, the MIT Health parking lot will remain open and accessible from Amherst Street via Wadsworth Street. For the latest construction updates, visit the Eversource project website. Questions about measles vaccination?MIT Health has answers.

        "body": "Hi everyone, It is a reminder that the final exam takes place next Wednesday, May 21 from 9am-11am. The location is 50-340. It is recommended that you arrive at least 10 minutes earlier. The exam will start at 9am (not 9:05). This will be a closed book exam. No book, no cheatsheet, no calculator is allowed. Scratch paper will be offered by us so you don't need to bring paper. During the exam: Be clear about which results you invoke, state them using their names (e.g. Bolzano- Weierstrass, Intermediate Value Theorem). If you can’t remember their names, write down the statement of the theorem or proposition you are using. You can use the result across problems only if you have proved them correctly, but you can use results across subproblems even if you didn't solve it. In case you need to cite results you proved in the other problem(s), please cite clearly. Final scope: The final exam scope will be everything in our lectures notes from Mar17 to May13, involving Series, Continuous/Differentiable functions, Integrals, Limit of functions. This corresponds to the content in the textbook from Chap2.5 - Chap6.2.1 + Prop 6.2.11 The content in the textbook that are not covered in our lecture will not appear in our exam, e.g Chapter 2.6.4; 4.4; 6.1.3; Therefore, the materials before Midterm will not be explicitly tested. However, you are still expected to be familiar with these contents as the later materials might rely on them. For example, problems on continuous function/series/integrals might require knowledge of sequence; you might find it helpful to use denseness of rational/irrational for exotic functions defined using Q, etc Some remark: The Review we did on May 13 is not exhaustive so you are still expected to to be familiar with all the materials on lecture notes, as specified in the final scope. However if you time is limited, you may prioritize the materials that are related to the Review. Good luck! Best, Jingze View announcement | Update your notification settings"

        "body": "“Of the Fortune 500 Companies, 163 CEOs are Marines…” -Ray Mabus, Secretary of the Navy Hello Nathra As you prepare yourself to graduate from high school in these next few months and plan to start college, you should consider an opportunity to obtain practical leadership experience and distinguish yourself from your peers. I would like to inform you about what Forbes and Inc. Magazine call “the best leadership and management training program in America.” Marine Officers obtain invaluable leadership experience that imbue them with the highest standards of judgement, dependability, initiative, decisiveness, and integrity. Marine Officers immediately begin in a mid-level management position directly in charge of 40 to 70 subordinates. Whether you do 4 or 20 years in the Marine Corps, our Officers reach their full potential and return as more productive, capable members of society. Platoon Leaders Course offers first years and sophomores to do two 6-week courses in Quantico, Virgina during the summer then once more after your junior year. For juniors, it would be one 10-week course after your junior year. Once you graduate College, you can accept or deny the position as a Marine Officer. Marine Officers can serve in more than 30 roles, including finance, logistics, supply, marketing, intelligence, law, combat arms, and aviation (helicopters, planes, and jets). Starting salaries range from $93K to $132K in the Boston area. Benefits include: · Attend a no-military service obligation program at Officer Candidate School. (Graduates reserve the option to accept or decline the commission.) · Current employers are required to hold your positions while attending OCS, per federal law. · Current leases may be broken, per federal law. · Fully funded tuition for advanced degrees (can be passed to dependent family members). · Non-taxed housing and food allowances. · Full medical and dental coverage. · Traditional Pension and 401K retirement plan. Basic Qualifications: · U.S. Citizen. · Medically and physically fit for service in the Marine Corps. · 35 years of age and under. · ACT: 22 (minimum) · SAT: 1000 (minimum) · ASVAB: 74 (minimum) Please reply to this email and CC Captain Connor Flynn at connor.flynn@marines.usmc.mil for more information and instructions to apply. Testimonial from Second Lieutenant David Tsai, USMC (Yale ’23) and new Marine Officer from Boston, MA: “After graduating from Yale University in 2023, I attended and completed Officer Candidates School (OCS) in November 2023. While OCS is challenging, it is basically just one long job interview designed to test you under pressure. I have found my experience with the Marine Corps to be immensely rewarding. The Marine Corps also has paid summer internships that enable undergraduate and law students to train during their summer breaks. I received fantastic mentorship prior to OCS and following graduation from the team at Recruiting Station Boston. The Marine Corps has varied and interesting opportunities to serve at various locations within the United States and internationally. The camaraderie in the Marine Corps is particularly strong, and the mission-driven purpose is why I joined.”"

This year, we have Melanie Matchett Wood from Harvard University as our speaker. Of course there will be a reception afterwards. Here is the info: Title: Finite quotients of 3-manifold groups Date: Monday May 12 Time: 12pm Abstract: It is well-known that for any finite group G, there exists a closed 3-manifold M with G as a quotient of the fundamental group of M. However, we can ask more detailed questions about the possible finite quotients of 3-manifold groups, e.g. for G and H finite groups, does there exist a 3-manifold group with G as a quotient but not H as a quotient? We answer all such questions. To prove non-existence, we prove new parity properties of the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold, in the sense of Dunfield-Thurston. This is joint work with Will Sawin. Everybody is welcome to join for the whole event or part of it (certainly the reception). Best, Ju-Lee"

        "body": "View this email in your browser TLDR: Institute/Faculty Committees provide an opportunity for students like you to have a say in how important decisions are made at MIT. Apply for a committee by May 15th to make your voice heard. Fellow Undergrads, While this semester may be almost over, with only a few days left until classes and exams are finished, now is your opportunity to have a real impact on MIT by applying to serve as a student representative on one of MIT's Institute or Faculty Committees. Applications are open until 11:59 pm on Thursday, May 15th. What do Institute and Faculty Committees Actually do? Institute/Faculty Committees are groups of faculty, staff, undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs that work together to create policy and guidelines for MIT. There's a whole bunch of these committees, and each one focuses on a different topic. (See ua.mit.edu/institutecomms for the full list of actively recruiting committees.) What Impact can I have? The UA has the opportunity to send student representatives to these committees. As a representative, you will be in a unique position to advocate for the student perspective in the rooms where policies and guidelines that could affect MIT for the next months, years, and even decades, are created . From discussing how to improve admissions and financial aid policies with the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions on Financial Aid to talking about potential changes to educational policies like the General Institute Requirements on the Committee on the Undergraduate Program, there are many different ways you could potentially make a difference through serving on an Institute or Faculty Committee. How do I apply? If you've read this far, this message is for you: The UA wants you — yes, you — to help shape the Institute’s future. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I know this can be a busy time of year; in recognition of this, the application isn't asking for several multi paragraph essays or anything needlessly time-intensive and burdensome like that; you just need to write a paragraph or two explaining why you are interested in joining the committee you choose. Applications to serve as an undergraduate representative on a committee are due at 11:59 pm on Thursday, May 15th. Good luck with finals, and I hope to see your application soon!

Administration accomplishments! Hey Everyone, On my final day as president, it brings me great pleasure to introduce the person I’m so proud to pass the baton to: your next student body president, a fellow course 10 (best major), and my good friend, Alice Hall. Alice ran on a powerful vision: that student government should be for you, about you, and accessible to you. She’s already shown what it means to lead with compassion, clarity, and a deep belief in putting student voices first. I’ve gotten to see Alice’s leadership blossom as UA Education co-chair, and her signature initiatives and work to increase faculty/student lunches access, organize semesterly faculty banquets, and offer education-based UA reimbursements has touched hundreds of students. Alice is committed to making real changes that actually affect your life at MIT. Her leadership style is transparent, thoughtful, and relentless in its focus on putting students first. I couldn’t be more excited for what she and her team will build. We’re in incredibly good hands. To help celebrate the new administration, we’ll be hosting our final Free Food Friday at 2 pm on Stud 4 (we’ll have Chick-fil-A, Boba, and Bon Chon). Additionally, the final Waffle Wednesday will be next week at 12. As we step down, I want to leave you with a snapshot of the work we, as students, organizers, and advocates, have accomplished together this year. None of these wins happened alone. They happened because students showed up, at meetings, at town halls, in Senate chambers, and in Google Docs at 2 a.m., to build something better. That’s how democracy works. Not as a grand gesture, but as the slow, methodical, and often-unseen work of people who care enough to keep showing up. And while this role draws to an end, I’m more convinced than ever that our best work is yet to come. Dream big, be kind, and remember—every person is a world waiting to be understood. Thanks for letting us be a small part of yours. Love you all. Always.

        "body": "Vice Provost Philip Khoury to step downView online versionDear colleagues,I write today to announce that Philip Khoury will step down as vice provost for the arts effective August 31. Philip plans to return to the faculty following a sabbatical. A record of accomplishmentSince arriving at MIT in 1981, Philip has championed what he calls the Institute’s “artistic ecosystem,” which sits at the intersection of technology, science, the humanities, and the arts. Thanks to Philip’s vision, this ecosystem is now a foundational element of MIT’s educational and research missions and a critical component of how we advance knowledge, understanding, and discovery in service to the world. An accomplished political and social historian of the Middle East, Philip joined the faculty as an assistant professor and later served as dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) from 1991 to 2006. In 2002, Philip became the inaugural Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS.Philip was appointed associate provost in 2006 with a dual portfolio of beginning a review of MIT’s international activities and enhancing the Institute’s nonacademic arts programs. As the Institute's first coordinator of MIT international activities from 2006 to 2011, he led the production of an influential report on the state of MIT’s international activities and sought ways to encourage more partnerships with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and parts of the Middle East.Under Philip’s nearly two decades of arts leadership, our artistic ecosystem has flourished. He stewarded and cultivated the financial resources and facilities required to advance the arts at MIT by helping to lead the cross-disciplinary Center for Art, Science, and Technology (CAST) and by collaborating with the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT). And, during his service, physical testaments to the arts have sprung up across campus, from the Theater Arts Building to the new MIT Museum and Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building. Most recently, Philip and his team – in partnership with faculty, students, and staff from across the Institute – oversaw MIT’s new festival of the arts, known as Artfinity. Launched in February and open to the public, the Institute-sponsored, campus-wide festival featured a series of 80 performing and visual arts events. To learn more about Philip’s record of accomplishment, please read the MIT News article published today. Looking aheadLast June, I announced – in partnership with Philip, Dean Hashim Sarkis of the School of Architecture and Planning, and Dean Agustín Rayo of SHASS – that the Future of the Arts at MIT Committee would advise the Institute on new ways to envision the place of the arts in our community. Last week the committee shared a draft report that contains recommendations to guide the Institute in writing the next chapter on the arts at MIT. With this blueprint in hand and with Philip staying through the end of the summer, President Kornbluth, my successor as provost, and Philip will reflect on the Institute's path forward in this critical space. With gratitudeI am grateful to Philip for all he has done to nurture a thriving artistic ecosystem at MIT. Please join me in thanking him for leadership and dedication to the MIT community.

There's a whole bunch of these committees, and each has a different focus. (See ua.mit.edu/institutecomms for the full list of actively recruiting committees.) One committee meets regularly with President Kornbluth to workshop ideas for the Institute as a whole. Another sits down with Admissions and SFS to talk financial aid for the upcoming year. There's something for everyone! Recruitment 2025-2026 The UA has the opportunity to send undergraduate representatives to these committees. These representatives are our advocates — they share equal status on the committees with all other members and make sure the undergrad perspective is seriously considered during the policy-making process.

Best, Thomas --- Speaker: Joshua Bloom, Professor of Astronomy, University of California Berkeley Title: “AI Accelerating Inquiry and Insight in Astrophysics” Abstract: The astrophysical data deluge has swamped traditional workflows, fostering a growing reliance on AI/ML tooling. Yet despite successes in post-data collection analysis with AI/ML, we are only beginning to realize its full potential across the broader scientific endeavor. From real-time control, to survey optimization, there is tremendous potential for AI/ML to improve the upstream efficacy of data collection. Likewise, downstream from data are exciting opportunities for AI-enabled hypothesis generation and human-centered exploration. I will ground this talk with specific examples of ongoing work in simulation based inference, self-supervised multi-modal foundation models (AstroM³), Rubin/LSST active optics, and neural compression (AstroCompress). --- Date: Friday, May 9, 2025 Time: 2:00-3:00pm ET Attend in Person: MIT Kolker Room (26-414) Join on Zoom: https://mit.zoom.us/j/91200832411 Watch on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueoFcGm_15kSB-wDd4CBZA -- Thomas Bradford Project Coordinator, IAIFI he/him | tsbrad@mit.edu Office: 26-539, Laboratory for Nuclear Science"

        "body": "Math Majors! Now that pre-registration is in progress, you should be aware of how to sign up for CI-H/CI-HW and CI-M subjects. Preregistration began : Yesterday, May 1st *** For all CI subjects, it is essential that you pre-register by June 13th NOT the final deadline in August or you will miss the Lottery*** Here's what you need to know: CI-H/HW subjects: If you wish to take a CI-H/HW subject, you must submit pre-registration to ensure your choices are included in the prioritized scheduling process for these subjects. If you miss the deadline, you will not be able to request prioritized scheduling for CI-H/HW subjects and will only be able to place yourself on waitlists for these subjects. The listing of CI-H/HW classes can be found at http://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/communication-requirement/ci-hhw-subjects/listing CI-M subjects: All CI-M Math subjects have limited enrollments. If classes are over-subscribed, then admittance is determined by lottery based on students who pre-register by the *June 13th* deadline. The lotteries will be conducted in July and you will be notified of the outcomes via email by late July/early August. Note that you must have the stated pre-requisites for the class (or explicit permission of the instructor; cc: me) to be entered into the lottery. This Fall the Department of Mathematics will be offering the following Communication-Intensive (CI-M) classes: 18.100Q, 18.104, 18.204, 18.424, 18.604, 18.704, 18.821 As a reminder, the Course 18 and 18C CI-M subject requirements are: * two from the list: 18.104, 18.204, 18.384, 18.424, 18.434, 18.504, 18.604, 18.704, 18.784, 18.821, 18.904, or 18.994 or * one from the above list and one of the following subjects: 8.06, 14.18, 14.33, 18.100P, 18.100Q, 18.200, or 18.642[fall 2017-2018 only] (or 6.033 for Course 18C only). Note the addition of 14.18, starting in the 2022-23 academic year. Also, be warned: Based on past experience, I expect several subjects to be highly over-subscribed, sometimes so much so that I can only admit seniors -- and not even most of them! Even final-term seniors have no guarantee of admission into their top choice subject. So, it makes sense to have a Plan B. If you pre-register for multiple CI-M's but have strong preferences among them (e.g. \"I really want X, and enrolled in Y only as a back-up\"), send me an email to let me know, and I will take this into account when I run the lotteries. You can also email to let me know about other special circumstances I should take into account (e.g. early graduation, special deals with other departments to double-count subjects, etc.). Good luck to you all! Charlotte  Charlotte Rubel (she/her) Assistant Program Coordinator MIT Math 978.500.7128 Room 2-110"

Above the Fold: ORCD Seed Fund and Beyond GPU Update In April we finalized our first seed fund awards. We ended up selecting eight projects out of forty-one total submissions. The number of projects selected was ultimately limited by the number of H200 GPUs (32) we could allocate to seed fund projects at this stage. All forty-one were cool projects and we enjoyed reading everyone's submissions. We will have another round of seed fund solicitations in the fall with more GPUs available. Michel and Lauren are in the final stages of rolling out a mix of 300 L40S and H200 public GPUs. These purchases are funded through support from the School of Engineering, the School of Science, the Schwarzman College of Computing, the Provost’s Office and from ORCD philanthropic support - thanks to everyone involved for the funding contributions. The public GPUs will be coming online during May, together with new flash storage that can keep up with fast GPUs! We will be working actively to get feedback from seed fund projects and from researchers using the public GPUs on how best to operate these resources to help everyone’s research.

Design, develop, implement, and test lightweight LLMs optimized for mobile devices to enable offline, real-time processing with efficient resource use. 2. Assist with the design of a hybrid architecture that dynamically adapts processing between cloud and the edge. 3. Enhance symptom-to-disease mapping using AI algorithms that can adjust dynamically based on various parameters. 4. Assist with handling of external data from different communication protocols to serve as inputs to the LLMs. 5. Assist with the design of continuous tracking of user conditions post-consultation to incorporate ongoing doctor feedback and to provide insights for addressing and improving future health conditions. We are giving preference to students who can begin immediately and then continue on a substantive basis over the fall, and possibly further too. Students working with Dr. Gupta usually continue to be members of his group -- moving to another project in his group in few cases -- for multiple semesters. If you have no other commitment for the summer and/or are willing to work from MIT, please mention this in your application. Work on project can be used towards your M Eng thesis.

In this talk, we explore the role that heterogeneous information plays. Across decision-making, pricing, and production tasks, we show that social outcomes improve as information diversity increases. We discuss implications for the development, deployment, and use of AI. Bio: Manish Raghavan is the Drew Houston (2005) Career Development Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Before that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS). His research centers on the societal impacts of algorithms and AI.

We will have two sessions in need of TAs.1) Independent research and paper writing, meeting Tuesdays and Fridays from 9:30--11:30 AM Pacific time from June 10--July 112) Differential geometry, meeting Tuesdays and Fridays from 9:30--11:30 AM Pacific time from July 15--August 15Since these classes are at nonoverlapping times, it is possible to TA for both of them. All times listed are in Pacific time. All classes are online, on Zoom. For the most part, work will be limited to the class times; you will not be expected to do much, if any, work outside of class.As a TA, you will be assigned to work with around 5 students per class, meeting with each of your students each session to go over their progress (for the IRPW classes) or the problem set from the previous session (for the differential geometry class) 1-on-1 during each class meeting.I will pay $750 per class. You must be eligible to work off-campus, which in practice means being a US citizen or permanent resident. You must also be physically located in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania. If you are located elsewhere and would otherwise be interested, let me know anyway in case I decide to register as an employer for more states, but I do not guarantee this.In the IRPW class, each student will be assigned a topic to write a long expository paper on. I will pair the students with the TAs based on the TAs' level of comfort with the students' topics.If you are interested, or if you have any questions, please send me an email at simon@eulercircle.com. Please send me a CV, a description of your mathematical experience, information about what teaching you have done so far, and anything else you think might be relevant. If you don't feel comfortable with this material but may be interested in TAing for a different class in the future, please also send me an email saying that, so that I can add you to the list of potential TAs for future terms. If you are not sure whether this is right for you, but it might be, you should still contact me, and we can figure it out together.Thank you,Simon Rubinstein-SalzedoEuler Circle"

I’m writing to address a few ongoing concerns about the after-hours use of the iHQ space and to ask for your cooperation in maintaining a respectful and safe environment for our community. Here are a few important reminders: Cleanliness: Food containers, napkins, bottles, and other trash have been left on tables, couches, and floors. Please clean up after yourselves and use the wipes, trash, and recycling bins provided. Staff Desks Are Off-Limits: Students have been found working at staff desks and, in some cases, removing staff belongings, including monitors. These are not shared co-working areas. Please respect staff workspaces and personal property. Security Concern – Theft: There have been instances of theft from staff desks, which is a serious violation of trust. These incidents are being actively investigated. To clarify, designated student co-working areas are the open spaces on floors 3, 4, 5, and 6. These spaces are intended for your use and collaboration. Please avoid using private or staff-only areas unless you have explicit permission. If these issues persist, we will need to reconsider student access to iHQ after hours. This space is a shared resource, and continued access relies on our collective responsibility to maintain it. If you have any questions, concerns, or need support, please reach out to me or Greg Soloviev (soloviev@mit.edu), our Facilities Manager. Thank you for helping us maintain a safe, clean, and professional space for everyone in the iHQ community. P.S.

Examines the relationship of set design to theater architecture, emerging media technologies and dramaturgies of the 20th and 21st centuries. In addition to creating their own designs, students research, write about, and present the work and practice of a set designer. Lab fee required. MUSIC 21M.150 Accelerated Fundamentals of Music (1st half of term) TR 2:00 - 3:30pm in 4-364 – Saraydarian, garo@mit.edu Accelerated half-semester study of the fundamentals of Western music. Requires ability to read Western staff notation in at least one clef. Coverage includes intervals, triads, major and minor keys, basic musical analysis over a variety of idioms in Western music.

Course content is identical to 21M.151: 21M.150 is offered first half of term; 21M.151 is offered second half of term or during IAP. Limited to 18. 21M.139 Moments in Music: Introduction to Arranging (2nd half of term) TR 2:00 - 3:30pm in 4-364 – Saraydarian, garo@mit.edu Do you love listening to different covers of your favorite artists and songs? Are you intrigued by how a simple melody can be heard in a variety of colors and styles by different ensembles and instruments? The craft of arranging previously composed music, whether one’s own or another’s, is a way to express oneself musically in a variety of timbres, sounds, and textures. We will explore arranging as a bi-directional process: reducing a large score to a piano reduction and taking something as basic as a lead sheet melody with chords and expanding it to a larger vocal or instrumental piece. As a final project students will arrange a short piece of their choice for an a cappella or small instrumental ensemble. 21M.299 Studies in Global Musics: Pirate Songs & Whaling Chanteys MW 2:00 - 3:30 pm in 4-158 – Maurer, jmmaurer@mit.edu In this class, we will explore the role of music in U.S. maritime culture—both factual and fictional. From African American dockworkers’ songs in 19th-century Southern ports, to chanteys on American whaling vessels, to 20th-century folk revivals, to the singing pirates of film and video games, we will examine the musics that have animated the U.S.’s cultural fascination with the sea. Students will analyze primary source material including song collections, recordings, compositions, and viral social media videos. The class will involve frequent singing as an exploration of the repertoire and the cultural phenomenon of participatory chantey sings. No prior musical experience is needed (we will teach you to sing!). 21M.240 Critically Thinking About Music TR 2:00 - 3:30 pm in 4-158 – Tilley, tilley@mit.edu Seminar that develops skills needed to explore a broad range of musical questions through a diversity of music systems and cultures, research tools and approaches, and scholarly viewpoints. Engaging the ambiguity, uncertainty, and unsolved (or even unsolvable) questions in music research, students practice thinking humanistically and critically about their own priorities, assumptions, and understandings of musical knowledge while gaining the tools to ask new questions and conduct independent research. Strong emphasis on discussion, interdisciplinary thinking, and practical applications of research skills. Students taking graduate version complete different assignments.

        "body": "Hi everyone, I’m Carlos Gosen, a second-year LGO student in Course 1. I am part of a team of MIT students working on a startup focused on energy efficiency for HVAC systems in commercial buildings that will be a part of this summer’s Delta V cohort in New York City. We are trying to connect with EECS students for potential collaboration opportunities during the summer (and possibly beyond). We’re building a “Building Operations Assistant”: a software platform that overlays onto existing Building Management Systems to integrate data, run energy models, and generate ML-powered insights to reduce energy costs. One of the key features we are developing includes an LLM-based conversational interface that allows users (e.g., building operators and energy managers) to “talk to a building”: asking natural language questions about their building's energy consumption and performance. The role involves building the core software stack which includes data integration & infrastructure, ML/AI modeling, and user-facing application design. This role is ideal for someone who is interested in piloting technology in large commercial buildings, excited about AI/ML for building automation, and passionate to make a real impact on how buildings are operated and optimized. If you’re interested in learning more, please feel free to reach out directly. I’d be happy to share additional details about the project. Best regards, Carlos Gosen"

Please find the details below! Best, Thomas --- Speaker: J. Nathan Kutz, Professor of Applied Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington Title: “Learning Physics from Videos” Abstract: Sensing is a universal task in science and engineering. Downstream tasks from sensing include learning dynamical models, inferring full state estimates of a system (system identification), control decisions, and forecasting. These tasks are exceptionally challenging to achieve with limited sensors, noisy measurements, and corrupt or missing data. Existing techniques typically use current (static) sensor measurements to perform such tasks and require principled sensor placement or an abundance of randomly placed sensors. In contrast, we propose a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) neural network structure which incorporates (i) a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to learn a latent representation of the temporal dynamics of the sensors, and (ii) a shallow decoder that learns a mapping between this latent representation and the high-dimensional state space. By explicitly accounting for the time-history, or trajectory, of the sensor measurements, SHRED enables accurate reconstructions with far fewer sensors, outperforms existing techniques when more measurements are available, and is agnostic towards sensor placement. In addition, a compressed representation of the high-dimensional state is directly obtained from sensor measurements, which provides an on-the-fly compression for modeling physical and engineering systems. Forecasting is also achieved from the sensor time-series data alone, producing an efficient paradigm for predicting temporal evolution with an exceptionally limited number of sensors. In the example cases explored, including turbulent flows, complex spatio-temporal dynamics can be characterized with exceedingly limited sensors that can be randomly placed with minimal loss of performance. --- Date: Friday, April 25, 2025 Time: 2:00-3:00pm ET Attend in Person: MIT Kolker Room (26-414) Join on Zoom: https://mit.zoom.us/j/91200832411 Watch on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueoFcGm_15kSB-wDd4CBZA -- Thomas Bradford Project Coordinator, IAIFI he/him | tsbrad@mit.edu Office: 26-539, Laboratory for Nuclear Science"

The attention mechanism in Transformers is considered core to the architecture and enables accurate sequence modeling at scale. However, the complexity of attention is quadratic in input length, which makes it difficult to apply Transformers to model long sequences. Moreover, Transformers have theoretical limitations when it comes to the class of problems it can solve, which prevents their being able to model certain kinds of phenomena such as state tracking. This talk will describe some recent work on efficient alternatives to Transformers which can overcome these limitations.

Hiya Burton-Conner, Hope your CPW is going great so far (and shoutout to our amazing rush chairs for all the work they've been putting in!) A few reminders as the weekend gets going: CPW is completely dry. Please remove all visible alcohol and other substances for its duration! Follow the CPW/REX guidelines in our Bylaws. Promote BC and your floor positively, and don't make broad generalizations about other dorms. Most importantly, do not speak negatively about other floors. If asked about a floor you have no direct experience with, respond neutrally and suggest re-asking that question to someone else with experience. It is up to all of us to promote BC as the amazing place we know, and hating on other floors does NOT do that. Have fun, talk to lots of prefrosh, and enjoy the long weekend :) We also wanted to let you all know that BC Gov will be having our semesterly Whole-House Gov meeting (!!) at 8:30pm on Tuesday, 4/22, in the Porter Room. Come hear updates from your gov team, talk to BC exec, and discuss a potential toptionality policy for BC. There will be food! Cheers, BC Exec"

        "body": "Leading the Climate Project at MITView online versionDear members of the MIT community,I am thrilled to return to campus to lead the Climate Project at MIT. As I get started in this role, I want to share some of my thinking – and invite you to meet me and our team next month.Thinking about energy and climateThe world faces escalating challenges from climate change, as rising temperatures fuel more frequent weather extremes and threaten ecosystems, livelihoods, and human well-being. As I saw every day in my previous role as director of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, since the energy sector accounts for approximately three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is largely an energy problem. By addressing these twin challenges – developing and deploying clean, affordable, reliable energy solutions while abating greenhouse gas emissions – we can build a healthy, resilient, and sustainable future for all. In that spirit, after discussions about my recent experience, my new role, and my ability to be effective in it, President Kornbluth and I agreed that it makes sense to modify my title to Vice President for Energy and Climate.Our shared strengths and the role of MITThe MIT community’s depth of expertise in both energy and climate are what give me optimism and hope that we can lead the way, along with our partners, on this significant undertaking. The Institute’s history makes clear that when we harness and focus our collective strengths and knowledge, we are able to drive remarkable progress. The Climate Project is our opportunity to develop leading-edge solutions to tackle climate change. The magnitude of this challenge will call for collaboration across our community, new partnerships inside and outside of MIT, and transformational ideas every step of the way. With your talent, passion, and perseverance, I am confident that we can build a more vibrant future together.Connecting with the campusSince the launch, our faculty mission directors and our team have established the foundation for the Climate Project. Now, building on their momentum, I would like to invite you to join us from 3–5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 6, in Eastman Court. We will be there to share updates, exchange ideas, and help make connections within the community so we can work toward our goals.Learn more and RSVP at the Climate Project website.This gathering is just a start. Through the fall, I will be arranging focused conversations across the campus to share our progress and ask for your feedback.I hope to see many of you on May 6.Sincerely,Evelyn WangVice President for Energy and ClimateMassachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Ave | Cambridge, MA 02139This email has been sent to nathra@mit.edu.

More details below!-------------------------------------Speaker: Catherine D'Ignazio, Associate Professor of Urban Science and Planning and Director of the Data + Feminism Lab, MIT Title: Data Feminism in Action (part of the Harvard Department of Statistics Undergraduate Colloquium Series) Date/Time/Location: Friday, April 18, 11:30-12:30 in Science Center Hall DRSVP form: https://forms.gle/FQhL4b95C5Zbu3mUA Description:As data and AI are increasingly mobilized in the service of global corporations, governments, and elite institutions, their unequal conditions of production, their inequitable impacts, and the asymmetry of innovation becomes increasingly more apparent. It is precisely this power that makes it worth asking: \"Data science by whom? AI for whom? In whose interest? Informed by whose values?\" And most importantly, \"How do we begin to imagine alternatives for data’s collection, analysis, and communication?\" These are some of the questions that emerge from what Lauren Klein and I call Data Feminism (MIT Press 2020). In this talk, I will present the data feminism principles, along with my most recent book, Counting Feminicide (MIT Press 2024). Drawing from a large-scale participatory AI project, I will describe how we built technology with data activists and journalists to enact alternative epistemological approaches to data science that center care, memory and justice. These informatic practices constitute a form of \"epistemic disobedience\" to the reigning logics of AI and data science. Bio: Catherine D'Ignazio is a scholar, artist/designer and hacker mama who focuses on feminist technology, data literacy and civic engagement. Her 2020 book from MIT Press, Data Feminism, co-authored with Lauren Klein, charts a course for more ethical and empowering data science practices. D'Ignazio's second book, Counting Feminicide: Data Feminism in Action (MIT Press 2024), highlights how mainstream data science can learn a lot from the care and memory work of grassroots feminist activists across the Americas. Her research at the intersection of technology, design & social justice has been published in FAccT, the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, Big Data & Society, and the proceedings of Human Factors in Computing Systems (ACM SIGCHI). Her art and design projects have won awards from the Tanne Foundation, Turbulence.org and the Knight Foundation and exhibited at the Venice Biennial and the ICA Boston. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association\" group.

See the traffic maps for details. Ames Street site enabling – traffic pattern shift beginning in April Beginning April 22, and continuing until mid-May, enabling activities are scheduled along Ames Street. During this time, traffic patterns will shift; Ames Street, from Memorial Drive to Main Street, will become one-way northbound during project work hours. High levels of noise from drilling equipment and a vacuum truck are anticipated. Pedestrian and cyclist traffic will be maintained. Vehicular access to Ames Street will be maintained northbound from Memorial Drive and Amherst Street. Southbound access will be restricted. Ames Street will be plated over and returned to a two-way pattern after work hours each day. Some metered parking along Ames Street will be unavailable to accommodate the project. Access to Gray Way and the driveway at Walker Memorial (Building 50) will be impacted. Signage will be posted to direct pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists, and a police officer will be on location. Access for emergency vehicles will be maintained. Changes to the Tech Shuttle in Kendall Square will be coming soon. Details will be released in a separate email once the new route has been finalized. Ames Street between Memorial Drive and Amherst Street – beginning June 1 Beginning after Commencement, Ames Street from Memorial Drive to Amherst Street is scheduled to close to vehicular traffic through September. All vehicular access to this segment will be restricted at this time; vehicles will be redirected to use Wadsworth Street to navigate around the closure for access to East Campus. Note that pedestrian and cyclist access will remain available during construction. High levels of noise from excavation equipment and a vacuum truck are anticipated. Police will be onsite to assist with vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and signage will be posted. No shutdowns are anticipated during this work. Ames Street from Amherst Street to Main Street – beginning June 1 Beginning after Commencement, Ames Street from Amherst to Main Street is scheduled to narrow to one lane. Traffic through this area will be one-way northbound from Amherst Street to the intersection of Main Street; Ames Street will be plated over and returned to a two-way pattern after work hours each day. Southbound access will be restricted, and vehicles will be redirected to use Wadsworth Street to navigate around the closure for access to East Campus.

        "date": "Tue 4/15/2025 6:56 AM",
        "body": "Company DescriptionMagnolia Electronics is a data converter company founded by Luke Urban ('09, MEng ‘10) and Richard Clay (‘09) in 2022 to develop machine-learning enabled analog/digital devices. The company uses a different framing of the conversion problem to avoid many of the hardest physical problems associated with analog engineering.Magnolia’s approach is to split the analog signal into separate components, measure those components independently, and then recombine the measurements using a machine learning unit. This breaks apart the hard problem of quickly and precisely measuring analog information into two easier problems. Magnolia’s system first captures high-dimensionality data using heterogeneous, slow, loosely coordinated sampling elements, then uses neural networks, now a well-understood digital tool, to handle the complex interactions of the sensing elements.The company has successfully raised money by meeting its technical milestones, has strong relationships with its equity investors, and has recently been awarded an SBIR grant from the NSF.Role DescriptionWe are hiring a full-time employee for a Mixed Signal Engineer role. The Engineer's priority for the next six to eight months will be performing R&D tasks connected with building, debugging, and testing the prototype Serializer/Deserializer device of our NSF Phase I project. Our goal in this Phase I project is to implement a physical prototype of our SerDes receiver that demonstrates the key findings of our simulations, using off-the-shelf components. In the data transmitter, signal data is loaded onto an FPGA board and transmitted over a copper cable using a high-speed digital-to-analog converter and high-precision clock. In the data receiver, a custom bandpass array breaks the incoming signal into frequency bands that are then digitized by a bank of ADCs. The ADCs are timed by our custom clock. The data from the ADCs are then processed by an FPGA and offloaded to a computer. After completing the Phase I project, we will be turning our focus to building an integrated circuit implementation.The Engineer will be joining the founders in a very small team, and the majority of the work will comprise three tasks:-configuring and operating the FPGAs and evaluation boards, and debugging the component connections;-manipulating datasets produced by the prototype using our custom Python software;-training and evaluating models on the datasets using TensorFlow, and adjusting hyperparameters to optimize accuracy.The ideal candidate will have experience working with analog circuits and machine learning models, but demonstrated strength in analog design and ability to quickly learn functional technical skills will also suffice. We are not using LLMs and prompt engineering is not relevant to our work.The role is located in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area with some work from home flexibility. Because some of the work will involve physically interacting with the prototype device, the Engineer must attend the Pasadena area office as needed (expected 2.5 days per week at the office).Salary:circa $13000/monthOptional strengthsFamiliarity with neural network mathematical concepts: backpropagation, activation functions, etcGood object-oriented programming practicesFamiliarity with version control systems and environment managers, e.g.: Git, PyenvFamiliarity with numerical Python libraries (or equivalent): Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib Familiarity with linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and matrix operationsExperience building and training models using TensorFlow or equivalentRequirementsExperience with analog circuit designExcellent note-taking and record-keeping.

(deadline for UROP applications is April 15). This is for Summer 2025; I am in Ila Fiete’s group in the dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. requirements: - experience with PyTorch: building and training ML models - be cracked, and excited about neural data modeling - time commitment: full time haha; research proposal: - Foundation models have transformed NLP and computer vision, but their potential in neuroscience remains untapped. While foundation models do not directly provide simple and interpretable explanations of brain function, their capacity for capturing high-dimensional representations makes them powerful tools for advancing medicine and neuroscience. Applications include neural simulation, precise modulation of brain activity, and improved brain-computer interfaces. In the envisioned future, the human brain state can be decoded and interfaced with seamlessly. - Progress report: I adapted contrastive predictive coding from the ML literature for feature learning from human intracranial electrode recordings, without any labels. From the features, I can linearly decode things like speech presence, volume, and pitch of words that the person hears. The moonshot is to use this model for the downstream task of designing model-informed electrode stimulation protocols (which out of the 130+ electrodes to stimulate and how much) to activate desired features in the learned representation space, and testing those protocols in human subjects. Best wishes, Andrii"

        "from": "Sally Kornbluth <office-of-the-president@mit.edu>",
        "date": "Mon 4/14/2025 4:46 PM",
        "body": "Further responses to federal actionsView online versionDear members of the MIT community,I write to bring you up to date on developments in two areas where recent government actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT, diminishing our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world’s finest talent.One relates to federal funding, the other to our international community.Filing an additional lawsuitAs I’ve communicated before, we are responding to certain federal actions by going to court.In February, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a sudden cap on the indirect cost reimbursements required to conduct our research, we joined several peer schools and associations in filing suit. The court granted a permanent injunction, which remains in force while the government seeks to appeal.As a reminder, indirect costs cover essential things like data storage; hazardous materials management; radiation safety; the costs of maintaining and renewing research facilities and equipment; research administrative systems; and compliance with federal regulations. For many years, each university has negotiated with the granting agency a reimbursement rate that reflects factors like the regional cost of living.This past Friday evening, the Department of Energy (DOE) imposed a cap similar to that from NIH. DOE announced that, for grants to universities, it would no longer cover indirect costs at previously agreed-to rates and would instead terminate all grants unless they conform to a blanket rate of 15%. DOE grants support the work of nearly 1,000 members of our community.Today, we joined with several peer schools and higher ed associations in filing suit to stop this action.Visa and student status revocationsSeparately, as you likely know, unexpected visa and student status revocations have occurred at many colleges and universities, and 15 higher ed associations recently came together to seek clarity from the government.Since April 4, nine members of our community – students, recent graduates and postdocs – have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked.One of those individuals has now filed suit against the federal government. MIT is not a party to the student’s suit, which is being brought by independent counsel representing the student’s interests. But we have been in touch with the student directly, and we are extremely concerned that there appears to have been no notice or explanation from the government for the revocation. Our concern extends to all the members of our community who face such unexpected revocations, and we know that our international community – indeed our campus community broadly – is alarmed by the possibility of future actions.Our Office of the General Counsel has prepared several guidance documents, which you can access from this central page devoted to immigration and international travel resources. MIT also recently hosted an information session to answer the most common questions. If you have specific questions about your own situation, I urge you to reach out to the International Students Office or the International Scholars Office.To live up to our great mission, MIT is driven to pursue the highest standards of intellectual and creative excellence. That means we are, and must be, in the business of attracting and supporting exceptionally talented people, the kind of people with the drive, skill and daring to see, discover and invent things no one else can.To find those rare people, we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the United States and from around the globe. MIT is an American university, proudly so – but we would be gravely diminished without the students and scholars who join us from other nations.The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US – and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.Sincerely,Sally KornbluthMassachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Ave | Cambridge, MA 02139This email has been sent to nathra@mit.edu.

An update on BC merch for CPW: Currently there is a truly absurd amount of leftover BC merch from previous years. Realistically, the best solution for this is to continue distributing them to members of the community in an effort to avoid clogging up thrift stores and, eventually, landfills. (It would also be nice to open up some more storage in the vault!) Due to these considerations, we have opted not to produce a new merch design for 2025 CPW. Instead, we will be holding a tie-dye event for old BC merch from 2-6pm in the Porter Room this coming Sunday, April 13th. During this time, we will additionally be giving out merch from past years for free! Get one for your future child, your grandpa's chess club members, your human-sized cat, or simply stock up on pajama shirts! Thank you for helping us reduce waste. Even if you aren't interested in tie-dyeing, pick up some free merch during this time! A final note that we do hope for CPW merch to come back in future years. The faster we can redistribute the current overflow, the faster we go back to making new designs. Also, there will be BC stickers! Submit your designs to the sticker form. <3 Best, Evie"

        "body": "Project Title: Integrating Optimization and Natural Language Processing for Digital Mental Health Services Project Description: Interested in how analytics, Machine Learning, and natural language processing can be used to improve decision making in mental health services? We have an ongoing research project related to recommending better strategies for online cognitive behavioral therapy, which is an easier-to-access alternative to traditional in-person therapy. We have partnered with a company that is the leading global provider of evidence-based digital mental health solutions. In 2019, 15% of working-age adults were estimated to have a mental health disorder, resulting in 12 billion workdays lost to depression and anxiety at a cost of US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity (World Health Organization, 2022). Developing algorithms and policies that recommend better communication strategies with patients suffering from mental health disorders could help alleviate these issues. We intend to develop and use novel tools from machine learning and optimization to address these challenging problems, including integrating reinforcement learning and natural language processing to work with text-based data from our industry partner. We will also use patient-level data to run simulations in order to assess how our methods will perform. Responsibilities: The UROP student will be a full member of the research team and the whole team will meet weekly. In these meetings, we will work on modeling the problem, devising algorithms, building theory, discussing results, and setting further steps. Outside of research meetings, we will work with data, implement and test algorithms, and research literature. The most important responsibilities will be to process the data, code the algorithms, and run the computational experiments. Requirements: - Experience with Python and natural language processing is required - Experience with optimization is a plus Location/Department: MIT Operations Research Center (https://orc.mit.edu/) Time Commitment: Up to 20/hrs per week (on average 10/hrs per week) Timing: Duration of Summer term Compensation: Typical UROP rate of $16/hr Contact Person: Please send applications and questions to Professor Georgia Perakis (georgiap@mit.edu) and Joyce Luo PhD student (joyceluo@mit.edu). Applications should include your resume and a concise statement of why you are interested and why you would make a good fit."

First, I will survey examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, I will demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. I will hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, I'll discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis..

Quick reminder to pls keep the gym clean! Put plates and dumbbells back where they're supposed to go, wipe off handles, etc. So far we've been pretty good about this. After talking to various BC community members, people expressed interest in a stairmaster, punching bag, or concept 2 rowing machine. Unfortunately Housing + Res Services (HRS) is currently working through gym review projects, and so we can't add machines until the fall. Ceiling height is also a consideration for the stairmaster. FREE CONSUMABLES AVAILABLE! Starting today, after your lift / workout you can go to BC front desk and claim some consumables. Desk has protein packets (21g plant protein), electrolyte packets (Nectar zero calories), and creatine pills (ON brand, super easy). Don't claim more than one of each per day, and have reasonable proof that you just worked out. If people take too many I'll have to restrict usage. PUSH / PULL COMPETITION STARTS TODAY! Limited to one submission per day, video required. Summed over all days, highest pull up count wins a nice doorframe pull up bar, highest push up count wins a nice floor push up bar. Leaderboard spreadsheet up now! As always, email me if there are ever any issues with BC gym. Posters about consumables and the competition will go up soon inside the gym. Keep up the grind 😤😤😤😤 Lots of love, Your one and only BC gym chair"

Read on to learn more. About National Healthcare Decisions DayOn April 16, MIT Health invites you to join us as we observe National Healthcare Decisions Day. Thinking about your healthcare decisions is incredibly important — unexpected medical events or diagnoses can happen to anyone. National Healthcare Decisions Day is a great opportunity to make sure that you have discussed your healthcare wishes with trusted individuals, and that you have appointed someone to speak for you if you are unable to speak for yourself. In Massachusetts, you can do this by filling out a Healthcare Proxy form. You do not need a lawyer or notary public to fill out a Healthcare Proxy form. The form becomes legal once you sign it in front of witnesses. Throughout April, MIT Health is offering a series of events to help members of our community make these decisions. We have also collected together resources to help you have conversations with your family members. All Healthcare Decisions Day events are free and open to the entire MIT community. Learn more Healthcare Decisions Day walk-in eventWednesday, April 16, 3–5 p.m.Vannevar Bush Room (10-105)No registration requiredMIT Health will have clinicians on hand to answer any questions you have about filling out a Healthcare Proxy form. We will have witnesses available to attest to you signing your form, and, if you’re an MIT Health patient, we will enter the document into your electronic medical record. If you get healthcare off campus, we will make copies of the form for you to give to your primary care provider. Healthcare decisions webinar Tuesday, April 22, 3–4 p.m.Registration requiredMIT Health is hosting an online webinar to discuss the importance of advance directives and healthcare proxies. Chief Health Officer Cecilia Stuopis, MD, will explain what you need to do before filling out a healthcare proxy form and will provide tips for having important, difficult conversations with your family members.

Please find the details below! Best, Thomas --- Speaker: Akshunna Dogra, Postdoctoral Fellow, IAIFI Title: “Many-fold Learning” Abstract: Iterative optimization techniques - ranging from the nonconvex, nonlinear gradient methods central to machine learning (ML) to simple regression fits over small datasets - have been instrumental in solving a wide variety of problems since the advent of modern computing. However, beyond special cases of linear architectures and convexified settings, a unified framework for describing optimization dynamics remains in its early stages, especially in the complex, high-dimensional regimes characteristic of ML. In this talk, we explore the foundations of a general perspective on optimization dynamics, proposing a unified framework for gradient-based methods. We view optimization as a dynamic process over model sets, shaped solely by the problem of interest, the chosen architecture and their interplay, generalizing a large class of seemingly diverse theoretical and empirical insights into a coherent whole. Finally, we discuss the computational advantages of this unified approach and the limitations of applying a ‘one-size-fits-all’ methodology to diverse optimization landscapes. -- Date: Friday, April 11, 2025 Time: 2:00-3:00pm ET Attend in Person: MIT Kolker Room (MIT 26-414) Join on Zoom: https://mit.zoom.us/j/91200832411 Watch on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueoFcGm_15kSB-wDd4CBZA -- Thomas Bradford Project Coordinator, IAIFI he/him | tsbrad@mit.edu Office: 26-539, Laboratory for Nuclear Science"

The class offers theoretical and practical tools to navigate the complex, ever-changing ethical terrains of industry, science, and technology while reflecting critically on your personal, professional, and political roles. Students engage in small-group conversations about their own values as well as the moral, social, and political dimensions of their summer experiences. More about the class:Weekly virtual discussion sections run from June-August (potential in-person option for students in the Cambridge area). Final in-person project presentations are held in September. Summer tuition is not charged; the class is listed as fall enrollment. Choose between a more intensive 6-unit version of the course and a 3-unit one.All continuing MIT undergraduate and graduate students are welcome and encouraged to apply, regardless of year, program, prior ethics experience, or summer plans. For more information, updates, and frequently asked questions, visit elo.mit.edu/experiential-ethics or email us at experientialethics@gmail.com.Previous Experiential Ethics students who took the course reported high satisfaction with the course, increased knowledge and ability to engage with ethics, and increased interest in ethics. Testimonials include:“I absolutely loved taking Experiential Ethics... This class enabled me to more confidently discuss issues that I have observed but have not had the vocabulary to discuss.”“I enjoyed that I got to relate what we were learning to my internship over the summer. When I took [another ethics class] it felt very removed from my day to day life, so I appreciated the personal aspect of it and us being able to present on what we were doing for the summer.”“Being in Experiential Ethics completely changed the way that I view ethics, transforming my relationship with the field of AI, my research, courses at MIT, and the interface between science, technology, and society.”\"This class has made me realize just how important it is for engineers and scientists to think about the impacts and social implications of our work.““The class expanded my definition of ethics to not just include personal definitions of right/wrong, but to also include broader ideas of institutional/systemic ethics. It made me more aware of the articles and books and social issues that usually fly under my radar.”\"I think Experiential Ethics is crucial for anyone majoring in a technical field and beyond.\"Apply here by April 15, 2025 (11:59 p.m. ET)."

Click here to view. Lecture 15 Question 4/1/2025, 11:01:29 AM In page 3, we have:$$\\Pr \\left[G^{\\text{PL}}\\right] = \\Pr_{G \\sim G(n, d/n)} \\left[G = G^{\\text{PL}}\\right] \\cdot q^{-n} \\cdot \\# \\left\\{ \\text{proper } q\\text{-colorings of } G^{\\text{PL}} \\right\\}.$$When I try to derive it, I get that every proper coloring contributes $$q^{-n} \\cdot \\Pr_{X^{\\text{PL}}}\\left[G = G^{\\text{PL}}\\right] $$, where $$G$$ is sampled from the planting method, so we have to define less edges than usual, which gives $$\\Pr_{X^{\\text{PL}}}\\left[G = G^{\\text{PL}}\\right] >\\Pr_{G \\sim G(n, d/n)} \\left[G = G^{\\text{PL}}\\right] $$. So, the LHS is actually greater than the RHS, so the equation is more of an approximation? Please correct my understanding if I'm wrong. Click here to view.

Lecture: TR1-2.30 (E51-335) Recitation: F12 (E51-149) Explores how energy markets function, what changes as the world decarbonizes, and the role of new technologies in this change. Examines how market outcomes are influenced by policies, with a focus on environmental policies. Uses economic tools to analyze efficiency and public policy challenges in interconnected energy and environmental markets. Topics include how electricity markets are shaped by large-scale renewable penetration, how decarbonization policies affect different regions and socio-economic groups, measuring the social costs of climate change, and the role of critical minerals in a decarbonizing world. Students gain experience in linking theory to real-world policy problems, particularly through a team-based electricity market simulation that mirrors decision-making by market participants.

Participants will be entered into a draw to win a $50 tech card. https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_009qDHdIhqYxCxo Supported by an MIT Integrated Learning Initiative grant and led by Wiebke Denecke and Tristan Brown, with Johann Noh, “Measuring the Impact of Humanities Learning in an Age of STEM” examines the impact of SHASS and Humanities classes on the educational trajectories of MIT students and the opinions of MIT faculty and instructional staff on the present and future role of the humanities in Higher Education. We will publish an article with salient results from this survey to stimulate further debate in our community about how to provide MIT graduates with a well-rounded education. MIT will serve as a model that will hopefully inform debates across the country on ways to create and maintain successful and well-integrated humanities programs in an age of STEM prominence, but also on ways to meaningfully develop STEMAH (STEM+Arts+Humanities) curricula.

Hey Everyone, Welcome back! I hope everyone had a restful and rejuvenating break. As we dive into the final stretch of the semester, I want to share some exciting updates with you all. First, given the overwhelming success of free laundry, I am pleased to announce that—effective immediately—showers on campus will also be free for all, now with unlimited lukewarm water and water pressure that would make even your fluids professor blush (April Fools! But wouldn’t that be wild? Maybe next year...). Participatory Budgeting Updates On a more serious note, Waffle Wednesday is back this week! Make sure to stop by the Stud at noon and grab a free waffle as a well-deserved midweek treat. Make sure to fill out this form while you wait. Also thanks to participatory budgeting, we’re excited to announce that we’ll reimburse menstrual products for living communities while supplies last. Additionally, free menstrual products will be available in the UA chambers for anyone who needs them. If your living group would like to participate, please reach out to us at ua-officers@mit.edu for more details. Finally, we’ll be providing free stamps—dorm execs will receive a supply for their communities, and we’ll also have stamps available in the UA chambers for anyone to grab. MIT International Fair (iFair) The UA is proud to sponsor iFair 2025! Showcase your culture through food, art, fashion, and activities, or take the stage with music, dance, or other performances. Join us in the biggest cultural celebration of the year with interactive booths and live performances. To register your organization, fill out this application by April 4th. Email isa-execcom@mit.edu for more information. See you there! Updates on UA Advocacy in DC Beyond campus, over spring break, I went with a small MIT delegation to Washington, D.C. to advocate for policies that directly impact students. The discussions we had with lawmakers reinforced the importance of student voices in shaping national policy. Here are some key takeaways: Pell Grants: There is strong bipartisan support for protecting Pell Grants, with some legislators even signaling interest in expanding them. Department of Education: While some policymakers advocate for dissolving the Department of Education, we made it clear that such a move could severely disrupt student financial aid and access to critical resources. Endowment Taxes: Lawmakers are actively debating the taxation of university endowments, a major source of student financial aid and institute funding. While some view this taxation as a measure of accountability, we emphasized the potential negative impact on students, financial aid, and research. Free Speech & Student Advocacy: The conversations on student activism and free speech highlighted the need for student voices to remain at the center of policy discussions. There are members of Congress who are open to working with students to ensure our rights are protected on campus. These meetings reaffirmed that student advocacy matters—and that MIT students have a crucial role to play in shaping the future of education policy. If you're interested in getting involved, there are many opportunities to engage in these efforts. Every office we met with stressed the importance of hearing from their constituents (i.e., you!) to understand how proposed laws will impact their communities. You can always reach out to your representatives. Additionally, we were asked by several offices to collect student testimonies about how recent legislation or policies are impacting you or how your research impacts your local community. Please help us amplify your voices and send us your stories (at ua-publicaffairs-chairs@mit.edu). As my term as student body president begins to wind down, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude. It has been an honor to serve this community, and every initiative, policy win, and community-building event we've realized has been possible because of your engagement and support. Thank you for your trust and partnership. Let’s finish the semester strong—and I’ll see you at Waffle Wednesday!

Here are some statistics: Median: 75.5 Mean: 74.74 Std Dev: 16.14 Based on these statistics and our own estimates of this exam's difficulty, we are setting the following (very rough) guideline for grades: You should think of any grade >= 75 as an A, >= 60 as B, and >= 45 as a C. If you had a bad day on this midterm, please don't worry!

Under my tenure (reign?) as Sorting Rat, we have allowed BC residents to ask for floor switches every semester, and this semester is no different. If things aren’t working out with your current floor community, keep on reading this email to learn about requesting to switch to a different floor for the next school year (and beyond). Logistics wise, all you have to do is fill out a form (this form) and rank all floors in order of your preference. This form is due by 11:59 PM on Tuesday, April 1st. We will inform you of the outcome of this request sometime before Saturday, April 5. Then, you will participate in the internal rooming of your new (or old) floor, depending on their processes sometime during that next week – so keep your eye out for communication from the floor regarding that. After your room is selected, you will be all set to join that new floor community for the 25-26 school year and beyond. A few important notes. First, we cannot guarantee any floor switches. Additionally, we will not honor any requests for certain types of rooms, staples, etc. By ranking any floor above your current floor in the form, you are committing to move to that floor and the room you are assigned beginning next Fall. Note that your new floor may do internal rooming differently than your current floor! You should not make assumptions about the specific room you will end up in. However, you can be sure that you will not be moved to any floor ranked lower than your current one; you will just remain on your current floor. All of this is so that floor switch requests are meaningful, and we can prioritize those who would benefit the most from the switch. If you have extraordinary circumstances that this floor switch process cannot accomodate, we encourage you to reach out to the wonderful Maddie Cheeka (cc’ed). She has been amazing in supporting the BC community in all the ways possible during Margaret’s maternity leave. We (the RATs) work closely with her to try and solve as many problems as we can within our constraints. ANYWAY! Without any further ado, HERE IS THE FORM AGAIN! Please have it submitted by 11:59 PM on Tuesday, April 1st (not an April Fool’s joke)."

Given the very short handover period, they will receive particular support from both the current ESSI Division officers and from other members of EGU governance as they begin their roles. They will serve for a two-year term (2025–2027), and may subsequently stand for re-election for a further two years.\n\nThe slate of Council-approved candidates, their CVs and statements, as well as your electronic ballot can be found online at:\n\nhttps://www.egu-elections.eu/f382392a904951b163efee8fdf60e3b392f48a60458df4f/\n\nPlease note that your electronic ballot key is unique and will no longer be valid once you have completed your vote.

Have too many sketchy tupperware containers lurking in the back of your fridge that you’re afraid to touch? WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A SUITE FOOD WASTE BIN! I’m Haylea, and CC’d is Makenna- we’re the Sustainability Dorm Leads for BC working with MITOS to improve waste management in dorms. Right now, there’s a food waste bin outside the TV Lounge for you to deposit all your leftovers. But in addition, we want to try and give you a food waste bin in your suite! To make this happen, we need to see what suites are interested (and potentially order more bins to meet interest). These would be 2-gallon food waste bins that fit on a countertop or shelf. With a suite bin, you fill it throughout the day and then empty it into the downstairs bin by the TV lounge. The bins fit the small trash bags that are already available for each floor. This is an opt-in system for now, so suites that want to engage in this program can do so, but not everyone will have one by default. If you/your suite wants to opt in and get one of these 2-gallon bins, please FILL OUT THIS FORM! Note that only one person per suite has to fill it out. Please email me or Makenna if you have any questions! Cheers, Your MITOS Dorm Leads Makenna & Haylea"

Missing Laundry (pls pls help☹️) making one last attempt here—still trying to track down my missing laundry. summary: 2wks ago, my laundry was taken out of the dryer and placed on top of the machines where i couldn't reach. after i posted about it, anon responded saying they put everything in a trash bag below the dryer instead. when i went to get it the next day, the bag was nowhere to be found. i've since checked every corner of the laundry room multiple times and emailed seamus, who said it's unlikely that facilities threw it out unless it was actually inside a trash barrel. so i’m specifically asking now: did anyone happen to throw away a trash bag that was on the ground in the laundry room?did anyone move a bag near the laundry room trash can, where it might’ve been tossed later? again, atp, i just need to know if i should stop holding out hope. these were literally my most worn clothes, so i'd really appreciate any info/insights. thanks.

        "date": "Wed 3/26/2025 5:03 PM",
        "body": "View this email in your browser Dear MIT students, TLDR: This landing page has information about immigration and international travel of relevance to all MIT community members. There have been a lot of recent news reports and communications regarding international travel and immigration law enforcement. In this email we are collecting a few different resources that have been shared at MIT. These resources will likely be useful to all students regardless of your immigration status, so we encourage everyone to read through them. Note that several of them require Touchstone authentication. Travel and border related topics Ultimately, the choice of when, where, and whether to travel is a personal decision for each of us. This is true for both personal travel and work-related travel. Some of the below resources might help you make an informed decision and be aware of considerations if you do choose to travel. MIT’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) has prepared a comprehensive document detailing what to expect when leaving or entering the United States. You can access it here. This information is relevant to anyone planning international travel including US citizens. MIT OGC also has travel guidance reference cards that have concise information on what to do in case you are stopped at the border that you can print, fold, and keep with you when crossing a border in case you are unable to access your electronic devices. Reference card for US citizens here, and non-US citizens here. The MIT International Students Office (ISO) has regularly updated information regarding travel considerations specifically for international students (including US Permanent Residents) on their news page. The ISO also has a detailed guide for entering the US for various categories of international students that you can access here. Additional things to keep in mind If you are traveling with any electronic devices that contain work/research related files, especially an MIT-owned computer, get an authorization letter from your supervisor and the MIT export control office. For MIT-owned devices, make sure to clearly state that it is NOT your personal computer, as implying that a work device is your personal property will raise a flag. Remember to always carry your immigration documents. Especially if you are traveling (both international and domestic) or going to the airport to pick someone up, make sure to bring ALL of your ORIGINAL PHYSICAL immigration documents (Passport, Visa, I-20, Copy of I-94 record, proof of admission and finances). Photocopies or electronic copies are good to have but are not sufficient, and you should be aware of who you are handing over unlocked electronic devices to. If you plan to travel internationally and need to renew your visa, be aware that current processing times for visa renewals are uncertain and you may not be able to return to the US for a long time. Interactions with law enforcement besides at ports of entry MIT OGC has two guidance documents regarding what to do if there are immigration and law enforcement agents on campus. You can read them here and here. We hope the above listed resources are helpful for making informed decisions.

We are based in Palo Alto, have 5 people, and are rapidly growing. We are hiring full-time engineers across AI (applied / infra), full-stack, and safety / security experts. Applying for a Job: If you are interested in considering full-time roles with Reinforce Labs, please reach out to jobs@reinforcelabs.aiVision: Our vision at Reinforce Labs is to automate the time-consuming, cost-prohibitive, manual, and error-prone aspects of red-teaming, testing, user studies, and quality assurance. We will continuously and autonomously simulate diverse user personas, which interact with any product to proactively identify gaps. We aim to protect against downsides (e.g., safety risks) and enable upsides (e.g., opportunities for enhanced product experiences). Our product is a combination of a red team model and a blue team model, reinforcing one another. We’ve built the most advanced “adversarial AI” model that simulates bad actors, and a corresponding “Defense AI” model that defends against it. By automating adversarial and suboptimal user behavior, and defending against it, Reinforce Labs enables the identification and prevention of product failure modes, setting a new standard for product quality. We empower companies to build safer and more reliable products by providing real-time, comprehensive testing to identify and prevent unsafe failure modes.Founders: Anish Das Sarma, CEO (LinkedIn profile) brings over 20 years of experience in AI, and over 10 years of experience fighting fraud online. Anish co-founded Trooly, an identity and fraud protection service that was acquired by Airbnb in 2017. Anish has held leadership positions at major tech companies, including Google and Airbnb, combating issues across the safety spectrum. His academic background includes a Computer Science BTech from IIT Bombay and a PhD from Stanford University. Anish's expertise in AI and safety across large companies and his prior startup position him well to lead this new endeavor.Lukas Tencer, CTO (LinkedIn profile) worked in the AI space for the last 13 years and 6 years before in general software engineering. This gives him a unique blend of knowledge of general software engineering, ML engineering and ML research. Lukas worked at 8 companies over the last 19 years, from being the 1st employee in a startup, to being a director of 100+ people at Google, Amazon, Twitch and others.

We are already past the midpoint of the semester, so over the next two weeks (i.e. by April 11), you should meet your advisors for a brief check-in. Please contact your advisor to schedule a time. The meeting does not need to be long, but it will give you an opportunity to have a conversation that's not burdened by the administrative needs of Registration Day. A few examples of topics you might discuss: GENERAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Your advisor will appreciate hearing how things are going for you, in math and otherwise! ACADEMICS: How are you doing with your classes? If you are feeling overcommitted, you should discuss rearranging your priorities and dropping classes if necessary. The drop date (April 22, 2025) is approaching, so there is still time to work on that particular issue. SUMMER and LONGER-TERM PLANS: Whether your summer plans are set or still under construction, your advisor will be happy to know about them. It's also a good time to share some of your thinking about longer-term goals. Your advisor can assist you in making future choices of classes that align with those goals. If you're considering graduate school, your advisor can provide guidance about the process (recommendation letters, fellowships, choosing schools to apply to). GRADUATING SENIORS.

We’re also looking forward to some special events this spring. Read on to learn more. MIT Health Seminar Series: The Healing Power of Arts and Creativity Artistic endeavors rely on imagination, inspiration, inventiveness, and originality — and are uniquely human. Join Behavioral Health Clinician Lior Givon, MD, PhD, on Monday, March 31, from 12–1 p.m. for a discussion of the healing power of art and the ways humans evolved to use art to connect, share experiences, and create community. Sign up at health.mit.edu/creativity Mark your calendars: Healthcare Decision Day MIT Health wants to help you ensure that you have discussed your healthcare wishes with your family and loved ones and that you’ve taken the important step of appointing someone to speak for you if you are ever unable to speak for yourself. In Massachusetts, you can do this by filling out a Healthcare Proxy form. We’ll be available to answer your questions and help you fill out the form on Healthcare Decision Day, April 16, from 3–4 p.m. in the Bush Room (10-105). If you’re an MIT patient, we’ll even enter it into your medical record. Learn more about Healthcare Proxies. Colon cancer screening March is National Colon Cancer Awareness Month. This makes it a good time to remind you that if you’re 45 or older, it’s time to think about regular colon cancer screening, which is crucial for early detection and prevention. Want help in figuring out which screening tool is right for you? Learn more here. Do you need a mammogram? MIT Health offers screening mammograms, which are routine exams designed to detect potential signs of breast cancer in women who do not have symptoms. However, we do not provide diagnostic mammograms, which are used to follow up on specific concerns with a previous mammogram or to investigate new symptoms, such as abnormal nipple discharge, a new lump, or changes on the skin of the breast. When you call to make a mammogram appointment or schedule a mammogram online, we will ask you some questions to make sure we can accommodate you. If not, we’ll be happy to refer you to a nearby facility that can perform the screening you need. Feeling stressed? Pick up a book! This spring’s MIT Reads selection, Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle by Emily Nagoski, PhD, and Amelia Nagoski, DMA, is for everyone who has ever felt overwhelmed and exhausted by everything they have to do. You can get the book in different formats at the MIT Libraries or elsewhere, then join the authors in conversation with MIT Health’s own Dr. Karen Singleton on April 16 (in person or online) from 5–6:30 p.m. There will also be an informal, in-person, small-group lunchtime discussion on April 24. More information about the book and related events is available on the MIT Reads webpage. Meet the Providers: Israel Molina, MDDr. Israel Molina is a family medicine provider and MIT alum who cares for patients of all ages. Molina particularly enjoys caring for international families and is fluent in both English and Spanish. Meet Dr. Molina in this video, and learn more about his approach to caring for patients at MIT Health. About Meet the Providers: Get to know the professionals behind MIT Health. In this series of short videos, MIT Health clinicians share insights into their practice, their approach to care, and what inspires them about the MIT community.

Please come to the classroom at least 5 minutes in advance for preparation. This will be a closed book exam. No book, no cheatsheet, no calculator is allowed. Scratch paper will be offered by us so you don't need to bring paper. The exam scope will be everything in Chapter 1 (Real numbers) and Sequence in Chapter 2 that are covered in our lectures. (i.e up to the lecture on Mar 13) To help preparing the exam, I have uploaded a practice exam, which is available in the week 6 module (or in the assignment). The solutions will be uploaded later. The format and difficulty of the midterm is similar to the practice exam. However, the actual exam will be shorter than the practice exam, there should be around 5-7 problems (potentially with subproblems) in total. During the exam: Be clear about which results you invoke, state them using their names (e.g. Bolzano- Weierstrass). If you can’t remember their names, write down the statement of the theorem or proposition you are using. You can use all the theorems, propositions and the limits we computed in the lecture notes. You can use quote the results across subproblems even when you didn't solve it. You can use results you proved in the different problems within the exam, but make sure you quote where it is. You can't quote results from different problems that you didn't prove. For example, you may use result of P1 c) in P1 a) without proof. But you can't use result of P1 that you didn't prove in P2. If you proved a result in P2, you can use it in P3 but you must clearly write down where it is in P2. Best, Jingze View announcement | Update your notification settings"

        "body": "David Schmittlein (1955–2025)View online versionDear members of the MIT community,With great sadness, I share the news that Dave Schmittlein, professor of marketing and the John C Head III Dean of MIT Sloan from 2007 to 2024, died Thursday evening after an extended illness. Dave grew up in Northampton, a small city in western Massachusetts – the eldest of six and the first in his broader family to go to college. After majoring in pure mathematics at Brown, he earned an MPhil and PhD in business from Columbia. By 1980 he had joined the faculty at the Wharton School of Business, where he rose through the ranks of faculty leadership, eventually serving as deputy dean (2000–2007). In July 2007, he accepted the leadership of MIT Sloan.In his 17 years here as dean, Dave helped build MIT Sloan’s reputation and impact around the globe, worked with faculty to create first-rate new management education programs and substantially improved current students’ educational opportunities. He had a gift for capturing big ideas crisply, and one of his signature phrases conveys both the purpose and value of the education offered by MIT Sloan and his vision for running the school itself: “Organizations are the way that ideas change the world.”You'll find more about Dave and his extensive accomplishments in an obituary that will appear on MIT News and in the MIT Daily later this week.Since he arrived in 2007, Dave served on MIT’s Academic Council, offering his insight and guidance to three successive MIT presidents, including me. He was rarely the first to speak, but his incisive comments would help people see things in new ways and bring great clarity to any discussion. Though Dave and I overlapped only for his final year as dean, his wise, funny, judicious counsel left a lasting impression. From my earliest days here, he was incredibly welcoming, writing to me unprompted with astute observations and encouragement, pointing out when things were going well and offering his generous, gentle advice. I knew I could always call on him as a sounding board and thought partner, and I did. Since Dave stepped down as dean last year to attend to his health, all of us who worked with him have missed his quiet, witty, discerning perspective, unfailing good company and kindness.Dave was absolutely devoted to his family, and our hearts go out to them as they absorb this loss: His wife of more than 32 years, Barbara Bickart, herself an academic leader in the field of marketing, their grown children, Brigitte and Gabe, and the whole Schmittlein family.MIT Sloan is developing plans for a celebration of Dave’s life. If you would appreciate personal support in this time, I encourage you to reach out to our many campus resources, listed below my signature.With deepest sympathy,Sally KornbluthKey Campus Support Resources• DoingWell: Key support resources for the MIT community.• Student Mental Health and Counseling Services: Working with students to identify, understand and solve problems, and to help transform that understanding into positive action.• Student Support Services: An easily accessible hub of support for undergraduates.• GradSupport and the Graduate Assistance Information Network offer a wide variety of resources to help grad students and families deal with the unexpected.• Free, confidential, 24/7 assistance is available for faculty, staff and postdocs from MyLife Services.Massachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Ave | Cambridge, MA 02139This email has been sent to nathra@mit.edu.

Please RSVP here: https://forms.gle/dvuxcKQNBn9fvjSS9. Hello everyone, Join us for a unique and impactful event, the Ramadan Fastathon, where we invite our MIT community to observe a day-long fast, reflecting on the principles of self-discipline and empathy that are central to the holy month of Ramadan. This event is not limited to Muslims; it is an inclusive initiative aimed at fostering understanding, solidarity, and charitable giving within our diverse community. Participants are encouraged to fast from dawn (5:35 AM) until sunset (6:54 PM), refraining from food and drink, and are invited to donate the money they would typically spend on meals to any charitable causes. We are currently working with MIT Mutual Aid for Gaza to help address the hunger needs of displaced families in Gaza, so if you’d like inspiration for a charity to choose, please consider donating here: https://mutualaidgaza.org/#sponsor-meals-in-gaza. By forgoing a day's worth of meals, we can collectively make a significant difference in the lives of those in need. For more details on what Ramadan is and some common questions, here’s a quick guide: https://ing.org/resources/for-all-groups/calendar-of-important-islamic-dates/ramadan-information-sheet/ At sunset, we invite you to break your fast in Lobdell Dining Room (W20-208) alongside members of the Muslim community. If you are unable to fast due to health reasons, you are still welcome! This communal iftar (breaking of the fast) will be a celebration of unity and shared humanity, as people from diverse backgrounds come together to share a meal and build bridges of understanding. Due to capacity, please RSVP using the link above. We hope to see you there! Sincerely, MIT Muslim Students Association bcc’ed to dorms, spring-green for bc-talk"

In the statement, $$T$$ is the minimum time index such that $$Y_T=0$$, what if I change it to a stopping time $$T'$$ that is the minimum time index such that $$Y_{T'}$$ is $$0$$ or $$n$$?I know that it should not work when the stopping time is the first time index such that $$Y_T=1\\neq n$$ because in this case, a supermartingale can somehow just misses the value $$1$$ and go straight to zero, let's say, but what is preventing me from using the same proof method to use the $$T'$$ stopping time instead of the one in the lemma?I was thinking maybe it is because of the optional stopping time criteria, but then I also am not sure which one the proof is even using. Is it the third option, proving that the expected stopping time is finite and that the changes are bounded? Click here to view.

        "body": "Dear all, This is the grading assignment for Pset 5. I attached the solution and solution with rubric for Pset 5. The rubric is only a suggestion, so you can make necessary adjustments at your discretion, as long as it is consistent across all students. You should grade on Gradescope. The grading assignment is the following: Tristan will grade Problem 1 and 5; Sabine will grade Problem 3; Nathra will grade Problem 2, Mia will grade Problem 4. Each of you will grade your problem(s) for all students. Please try to finish grading by Mar 23 night (next Sunday) and let me know if there are any questions. Once everything is graded, Mia can you please post the grade on Gradescope? Thanks for your help! Best, Jingze"
