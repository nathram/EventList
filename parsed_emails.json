As you make your monthly installments, the balance will go down accordingly. Refunds If your balance due is a negative amount, this means you may be eligible for a refund. Please check your statement to ensure all of your funding has been applied to your account before requesting a refund. Email us at sfs@mit.edu to begin the refund process.

If you do not use direct deposit and still receive a paper check, please go to Direct Deposit Preferences in the About Me/Money section of Atlas to sign up. Direct deposit has many advantages over paper checks — it's safe, secure, and convenient — and you have immediate access to your pay, without having to deposit a check and wait for it to clear, as most banks give you access to your salary payment on payday morning. You can even have your salary deposited in more than one account or at more than one bank. If you no longer want to receive this notification, please change your preferences by clicking the Settings and Authorizations link at the top of the Paystubs page on Atlas. If you have questions about your paycheck or setting up direct deposit, please review the Payroll section of the Vice President for Finance (VPF) website or contact the VPF HR/Payroll Service Center at payroll@mit.edu or 617-253-4255.
