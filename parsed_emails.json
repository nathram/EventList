(Location shared upon registration.)Since graduating, Gavin, Chris, and Robert have built one of the most ambitious AI hardware startups, raising hundreds of millions from top investors like Peter Thiel, Jane Street, and Two Sigma.Etched’s chip, *Sohu*, is a transformer-optimized AI inference engine that runs over 10x faster than NVIDIA GPUs—unlocking massive gains in throughput, latency, and cost per token. This makes once-impossible applications, like real-time video and swarms of research agents, deployable at scale.Now a 150-person team, Etched includes top talent from AI, hardware, and quant research—including Brian Loiler (HGX/DGX, 80%+ of NVIDIA’s revenue) and David Munday (Google TPU v1–v5).https://lu.ma/etchedOn Fri, May 2, 2025 at 9:46 AM HUMA Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association <humathematics@gmail.com> wrote:Hi all,For those of you interested in AI hardware, check out this event from Etched https://lu.ma/etched.Best,HUMA Board -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association\" group.

I know the definitions, but are those definitions mathematically rigorous? What about the definition of verification or the definition of the size of the input to a problem? Click here to view. Requirement that oracles decide in constant time 4/29/2025, 9:06:14 PM Why is the assumption that oracles decide in constant time necessary? In particular, for $$P^L$$, why is it important that the oracle decides $$L$$ in one step? Wouldn't it be enough for the oracle to decide $$L$$ in polynomial time? If we changed our oracle from deciding in constant time to deciding in polynomial time, is it possible to leave polynomial time? Click here to view.

Design, develop, implement, and test lightweight LLMs optimized for mobile devices to enable offline, real-time processing with efficient resource use. 2. Assist with the design of a hybrid architecture that dynamically adapts processing between cloud and the edge. 3. Enhance symptom-to-disease mapping using AI algorithms that can adjust dynamically based on various parameters. 4. Assist with handling of external data from different communication protocols to serve as inputs to the LLMs. 5. Assist with the design of continuous tracking of user conditions post-consultation to incorporate ongoing doctor feedback and to provide insights for addressing and improving future health conditions. We are giving preference to students who can begin immediately and then continue on a substantive basis over the fall, and possibly further too. Students working with Dr. Gupta usually continue to be members of his group -- moving to another project in his group in few cases -- for multiple semesters. If you have no other commitment for the summer and/or are willing to work from MIT, please mention this in your application. Work on project can be used towards your M Eng thesis.

In this talk, we explore the role that heterogeneous information plays. Across decision-making, pricing, and production tasks, we show that social outcomes improve as information diversity increases. We discuss implications for the development, deployment, and use of AI. Bio: Manish Raghavan is the Drew Houston (2005) Career Development Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Before that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS). His research centers on the societal impacts of algorithms and AI.
