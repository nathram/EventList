I.e. what is the expected length? Do we need sources external to the lecture notes (or whatever paper/UROP/lab project we're studying)? How should it be formatted? Do we need to explain any tools/methods from class we end up using, or can we assume the audience knows these already? I.e. how much mathematical context is needed? I've never had to write a math paper before, and I assume some others in the class haven't either, so some more specifics would be appreciated. Click here to view.
